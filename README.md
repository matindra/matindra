 <h3 align="left"> Hello there! Welcome to my GitHub profile. Here's a little bit about me and what I do. <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="25px"> </h3>

Data is the raw material of the 21st century. It can be used to solve problems, make decisions, and create new products and services.

I find data fascinating because it is a way to understand the world around us. Data can be used to answer questions, make predictions, and solve problems. It can also be used to create new products and services.

I am also fascinated by the way that data is constantly changing. As we collect more data, we can learn more about the world and make better decisions. This is why I am so excited about the future of data science. I believe that data science has the potential to change the world for the better. Thats how I got attracted towards data world. I am currently working as a Machine Learning Intern at iNeuron Intelligence.

I have a strong foundation in data science fundamentals, including machine learning, statistics, and data mining. I am also proficient in programming languages, Like Python and SQL. Apart from the skills related to data capture, analysis & presentation, I possess good problem solving skills.

I am a highly motivated and results-oriented individual and I am also a team player. I am eager to start my career in data science and I am confident that I can make a significant contribution to any organisation I am going to work for. Along with Machine learning, I believe in Quick learning as and when needed.

<h4>üìù Projects:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <h5><a href=https://github.com/matindra/insurance-premium-prediction-project>Project 1: Insurance Premium Prediction</a></h5>
      <p>
        The insurance premium prediction project aims to develop a model that accurately estimates insurance premiums based on historical data. It involves analyzing factors such as policyholder information and claims history to predict future premiums, enabling insurance companies to make informed pricing decisions.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h5><a href=https://github.com/matindra/US-EasyVisa-application-status-data>Project 2: US EasyVIsa Application Status Project<a></h5>
      <p>
        United States Office of Foreign Labor Certification (OFLC) gives job certification applications for employers seeking to bring foreign workers into the United States and grants certifications. This model is to check if Visa get approved or denied based on the given dataset. This can be used to recommend a suitable profile for the applicants for whom the visa should be certified or denied based on the certain criteria which influences the decision.
      </p>
